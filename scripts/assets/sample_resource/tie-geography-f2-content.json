Individuals engaging in small-scale crop cultivation are known as peasants.

A farmer owns a small piece of land for food crops cultivation. The produce is enough only for the family. It is hand to mouth existence which may lead to famine if the harvest is bad. In years with good harvest the farmer may have surplus to sell to the local markets. The farms are small, about one to five hectares owned by the family.

People farm and move to another fresh area when the yields are low. The cultivator or farmer burns the forest and sows seeds in the intermixed ash and soil. Little attention is given to the crops until they ripen. If the harvest declines, the land is abandoned, and a fresh area is cleared. The yields decline after three to five years. The cultivator may return to the original land after some years. The constant moves ensure fresh land with high yields, as the land is fertile. There is no serious soil erosion since only a small area is exposed which supports many crops and therefore little bare earth is seen. Any soil washed is trapped by dense plant roots and at the forest edge. The system is less risky of diseases.

After independence of individual countries, the plantations were owned by government and others were allocated to individuals as small holders and peasant farmers. These plantations also known as estates are large and found in sparsely populated areas.",

The technology involves the use of tractors, combine harvesters, and processing machines. As large-scale farming is highly mechanized, it employs few skilled people because machines carry out agricultural activities that otherwise could have been done manually by humans.  \nIn addition, such commercial farming is capital-intensive to support the production. Also, it is often based on a single crop, a practise known as monoculture. Chemical fertilisers are highly used to maximise yields. Large-scale agriculture is basically a source of raw materials for different manufacturing industries.  \nFigure 2.1 Coffee plant berries  \nsource:https/www.gettyimages.com/photo/coffee-plant",

Plantation agriculture is dominant in some regions of Africa, Asia, North and South America where there are favourable climatic conditions. Extensive food cultivation deals with large-scale food crop production. Machines are highly used in ploughing, sowing, harvesting, processing, packaging, and transportation of farm produce.

Overgrazing is a situation where the number of cattle is greater than the carrying capacity of the grazing land. As a result, overgrazing causes soil erosion, land degradation, and loss of valuable species. Another feature of the nomadic pastoralists is the breeding process, which is uncontrolled. This situation may lead to the spread and outbreak of animal diseases, hence low animal quality and deaths.  \nIn addition, there is poor control of pests and other diseases, which result to poor quality of animal products. Furthermore, nomadic pastoralism takes place where the population is scarce as the animals are grazed in open range, which needs a lot of space.",

Currently, the authority has a sophisticated system of dams to control flooding along the Tennessee River watershed. This provides an opportunity of controlling the floods by controlling about $ 260 million in flood damage annually. To date, the operation of this system has prevented over US$5.4 billion in flood losses across the Tennessee Valley, including about US$ 4.9 billion in damage averted at Chattanooga the Valley\u2019s most flood-prone city.

The excess water is removed from the land by draining to make it useful for the intended purpose. An example of land reclamation by draining out water is the Zuider Zee Project in the Netherlands.

Moreover, using better methods of agriculture such as contour ploughing, terracing, and strip farming especially in steep slopes helps to prevent erosion.  \n(c) Land may also be reclaimed by restoring its fertility. In this case, land which has lost fertility may require planting cover crops and addition of organic manure and fertilisers to improve its fertility. The fertility will attract vegetation growth. Vegetation will not only bind the soil but also protect it from excessive loss of water through transpiration.  \n(d) Land affected by excessive animal keeping can be restored by reducing the number of animals in the area. This simple reclamation method allows the land to be proportionally used.",

The project strategies focused on promoting tree planting, bee-keeping, soil and water conservation, reclaiming degraded land, and local participation in conservation matters.

Ground water extraction and irrigation can increase salt concentrations in water. Irrigation can also cause salinization by raising the water table and lifting saline ground water near the surface into the root zone. This occurs when irrigation efficiency is poor, so a large fraction of irrigation water infiltrates into the soil, and groundwater flow is slow. A similar problem occurs in some regions when trees are cut down.",

The water may be polluted through discharging waste in it or mixing it with chemicals usually from factories and industries. Besides, water pollution is also caused by domestic practices especially channelling toilet waste into water streams. All the materials which pollute water are called pollutants. Water pollution is at times caused by the construction of latrines directly in the ground. This way of pollution affects mostly underground water. The latrines tend to seep wastes into the underground water. Many homes and industries with no access to sewerage systems rely on shallow underground disposal of waste.",

For example, Gombe Forests in Kigoma have chimpanzees, which are a great attraction for both local and foreign tourists. Many of the natural parks have forests that serve as habitats for attracting animals and plants.  \nRainfall formation: Areas with heavy forests are characterised by frequent rainfall. For example, in the Amazon forests, 30 percent of rainfall is said to be influenced by moist air from trees.",

Moreover, forests help to control soil erosion as they protect the soil from being eroded by blowing wind and running water.

Plants are eaten by herbivores; likewise, herbivores are consumed by carnivores who feed on meat. When they all die, their remains are decomposed by bacteria which break down dead matter and release nutrients into the soil. Therefore, forests have input in the food chain. Tree canopies control the evaporation of water from the soil beneath, hence allow more retention of water in the soil. The canopies also enable recharging of ground water by controlling over land flow after rainfall.

Veins and lodes are formed when molten materials containing minerals intrude and solidify into cracks and crevices. These are mainly associated with igneous and metamorphic intrusions. Examples of minerals formed in veins and lodes are tin, copper, silver, lead, manganese and zinc.  \nBed and seams constitute another type of mineral formation. Coal, iron ore, gypsum, potash, salts and common salts are formed as a direct result of deposition, accumulation and concentration in the horizontal strata of the earth\u2019s crust. Gypsum, potash and salts, for example, are formed by the evaporation of lakes in desert areas and later are covered by other deposits so that they appear as seams.",

The development of the textile industry depends on the availability of both internal and international markets. Since there is no country that can meet the demands of its people by only using locally produced goods, there is a need to produce more for export to get foreign currency. Textile industries also promote international relations through trade. There is so much trading in the world because of differences in resource endowment and climate. For example, there are countries producing cars (Japan) while others produce textile materials (Tanzania). This distribution of manufactures justifies the need for trading of the products among nations, which also helps build healthy and good relations.",

They can be built in both rural and urban areas, and do not destroy the surrounding environment. However, nuclear energy is difficult to harvest and nuclear plants are very complicated to build and run. Likewise, in many communities there is limited capacity to develop a safe and reliable nuclear energy programme.

Accidents and the resulting loss of life and destruction of property have assumed intolerable proportions. A major weakness in this area is associated with lack of responsible personnel for road safety. In many cases, the major constraint common to all the weaknesses identified in the management of road safety is the lack of adequate financial resources. The poor safety record of many East African airlines is another area of major concern in Africa.",

However, in East Africa, the availability of such data is limited and poorly organised.

Such initiatives should focus on policy, strategy, resource mobilisation and capacity-building. The initiatives aim at translating policies and strategies into action. The following sections present some of the measures aimed to address the identified challenges.  \n- National policies and sub-regional and regional agreements: Tanzania has to demonstrate its commitment in improving the domestic investment environment by taking necessary steps. The actions need to target full liberalisation of the transport sector to attract investors, and strengthening the regulatory and enforcement mechanisms. In addition, improving co-ordination in developing and implementing regional and sub-regional agreements on transport facilitation and air transport liberalisation should be seriously considered.",

Also, responsible authorities need to develop and implement capacity building programmes to upgrade the knowledge and skills of staff involved in policy formulation, planning and implementation as well as those engaged in regulatory and enforcement functions.\n- Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA): The development of a sustainable transport system, requires carrying out an environmental impact assessment. This assessment should be incorporated into the infrastructure development plans of the country. In this regard, any plan for transport construction should undergo EIA processes before approval.",

This can be done by establishing effective institutional frameworks and strengthening the existing frameworks to manage traffic and ensure safety. Moreover, there is a need to ensure compliance with safety and security regulations and standards established by relevant local, international and regional authorities.\n- Transport information systems: Given the high demand for the use of information in the transport sector and inadequacy of necessary information in the country, Information and Communication Technology (ICT) offers a powerful tool for accessing, processing and disseminating large volumes of information in the shortest time possible.",
